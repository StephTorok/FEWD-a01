### The Old Me
Hi, I'm Stephanie. I'm a native German with a master's degree in **Translation Studies**.
I love to travel and lived in several countries. My favorite are:
* Portugal
* Scotland
* France
* USA

I was working as a subtitler for many years but over the last decade working in the translation industry as a freelancer became less and less rewarding. So, I decided to look for a new line of work. I always loved the arts and designing things and I consider myself to be a creative person. When I stumbled across the IMCP at San Diego Continuing Education, I thought I should give it a try and see where it takes me.  

### The New Me
I'm very happy to say that it took me straight to the FEWD program. I was always a little interested in web design as well and created my first web page 2003 to promote myself when I was on my first job hunt after getting my university degree. It took me three weeks to design it and I created it in Microsoft Word saving the seperate pages as html. I cannot even imagine how unprofessional that was knowing what I know today, but it worked and landed me a job at the second company I applied to. 
I can do a lot better than that already and look forward to diving a lot deeper into the subject matter.





One of my new found hobbys during the IMCP is video editing. 
Good friends of mine in Austria have a band and they asked me to make a video for their favorite song called _Der Folger_ (_The Follower_). You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MO_nRJcrV8).
